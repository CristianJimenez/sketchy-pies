# Sketchy Pies
A Sketch plugin to magically convert Circle layers into pie charts!

## Instal the plugin  
[Download](https://github.com/abynim/sketchy-pies/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents of this repository. Then double-click the Sketchy Pies.sketchplugin bundle to install the plugin. Remember, this will only work if you have Sketch updated to version 3.3 or above.  

## Usage
Using the plugin is easy:  

1. __Draw__ and __select__ a Circle on the canvas or artboard.

2. Run the plugin from the menu `Plugins` > `Sketchy Pies` > `Convert to Pie Chart`  
3. Enter color values for each slice in the Pie Chart, separated by commas.

4. Behold, your Pie Chart is ready!  
5. Each slice of pie will be a separate layer, in case you need to change the colors later.
